## 🌟 Quote of the Day

> *“Mathematics is the language in which the universe is written.”* — Galileo Galilei

> *“Functions connect quantities; understanding how they compose is the first step to connecting ideas.”*

> *"A limit is not about reaching the point, but about understanding what happens infinitely close to it.”*
